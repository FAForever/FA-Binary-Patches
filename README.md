# Binary engine patches

This repository contains documentation about the executable and various binary patches written in assembly and/or C++.

## Changelog

You can learn more about the changes in the [changelog](./changelog.md). All notable changes to this project will be documented there.

## Piracy concerns

Due to piracy concerns we can at no point upload the executable as an artifact. We do not want the lua-compatible executable available to the public without verification that they own the game. The compatible executable is distributed via the [Official client](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client). Before a user can use such end points his or her account needs to be verified. An account can be verified by linking it to a [Steam](https://www.faforever.com/account/link) and/or [GOG](https://www.faforever.com/account/linkGog) account that owns a copy of Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.
